# Summary
This library provides for the implementation of the PBWT-sec [1].

# List of Supported CPUs and Operating Systems
* Intel 64-bit Core 2 Duo or newer Intel 64-bit CPUs
* 64-bit Linux (tested on ubuntu 13.10)

# List of Supported Compilers and Prerequisite Tools
* gcc 4.8.1 + OpenSSL 1.0.1e + GMP 5.1.2
* clang++ 3.0 or newer

# Installation Requirements

Create a working directory (e.g., work) and clone the following repositories.

       mkdir work
       cd work
       git clone git://github.com/iskana/PBWT-sec.git
       git clone git://github.com/herumi/xbyak.git
       git clone git://github.com/herumi/mcl.git
       git clone git://github.com/herumi/cybozulib.git
       git clone git://github.com/herumi/cybozulib_ext.git

* Xbyak is a prerequisite for optimizing the operations in the finite field on Intel CPUs.
* OpenSSL and libgmp-dev are available via apt-get (or other similar commands).

# Installation

  cd PBWT-sec/src
  make

* use tcmalloc (optimal) for Linux; sudo apt-get install libgoogle-perftools-dev

# Prerequisite Files and Libraries for Running Your Application
	* OpenSSL
	* GMP (libgmp-dev)

# Running PBWT-sec with a sample data
Server:
		
		mkdir /tmp/server
		./server -m <num_of_threads> -f ../sample_dat/1000G.pbwt -r 2185 -c 10000 -d /tmp/server/ -k /tmp/server/

Client:

		mkdir /tmp/client
		./client -m <num_of_threads> -h hostname -q ../sample_dat/client_input -d /tmp/client/ -k /tmp/client/

# Query file format
 	   1st line	 : A query bit string (e.g., 0000100010101000)
	   2nd line	 : A true column(allele) index to start the search
	   3rd line  : Either a true column index or a decoy column index for each line
	   ....
	   last line : -1
